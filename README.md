## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

SmartFin is built using a **state-driven agentic workflow** instead of a single monolithic LLM call.

---

## 🧩 Agentic Design (LangGraph)

The core intelligence is implemented using **LangGraph**, which allows explicit control over agent behavior.

### 🔸 State Object (`FinanceState`)
All agents operate on a shared state containing:
- User profile (age, income, expenses, risk)
- Financial calculations (monthly savings, goal timeline)
- Chat history
- Online search results
- Final AI response

---

- Normalizes user financial inputs

#### 2️⃣ Financial Calculator Node
- Estimates time to reach financial goals

- Ensures all numbers come from deterministic logic (no hallucination)

#### 3️⃣ Online Search Node
- Triggered only when user asks about:
  - Stocks
  - Markets
